# Web3rsvp-repo
 DApp project with WBW3. #30DaysOfWeb3
** Revised update ** 

Problem: Too many no-shows in web3 events.
Solution: A dapp that connects to your wallet for a RSVP deposit for accountability and encouraging active attendance. 

I believe the first time I forked this repo from Women Build Web3, I made some mistakes and decided to start over with this repository. 
The mistake I made was forking the Hardhat sample repository and trying to use it for the Web3rsvp website, when the Hardhat sample was meant to be a sample/test.
There were some errors in my code and a cohort community member was able to help me through. 
That help led to restarting the setup of the project. 

In this repo, you will see:
- developer setup
- defining data structure 
- defining functions
- test script
- smart contract deployment 
- smart contract verification

Tools = Node.js, NPM, Git, GitHub, Solidity, Infura
